## Introduction

To read a small introduction, please read the [introducary report](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Semantic-Search-Engine/blob/main/Introductory%20Report.pdf)

The purpose of the project is to develop a semantic search engine in the English language, the search is done within a set of news from the .bbc station, represented in an xml file, that can be found [here](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Semantic-Search-Engine/blob/main/bbc_rss_feed.xml).

In order to achieve semantic research, semantic linguistic processing is carried out either on documents or on the query, and since the query is smaller, the semantic analysis is applied on it.

## Used Software and Requirments

The project is accomplished using Java programing language, [Lucene software](https://lucene.apache.org/) for Document Indexing and Searching, [Standford CoreNlp](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) for processing both documents and query, and [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) for finding synonym phase during language processing process applied on the query. 

In order to run the project in a local device, you can download the project and open it in a Java IDE, for example: [Apache NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/). As prerequisites, the following should softwares should be downloaded:
1. [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
2. [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/downloads.html).
3. [Satndford CoreNlp](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html).
4. [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/download/current-version).

The jar files should be located in the [Jar folder](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Semantic-Search-Engine/tree/main/Jar).
